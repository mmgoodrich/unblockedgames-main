</style> <div id="gamedesc" ><wgDev>Folks, let me tell you, Asteroids is a classic arcade game that still holds up today.</wgDev>
<wgDev>It's tremendous, believe me, and it's a game that you absolutely have to play.</wgDev>
<wgDev>Released way back in 1979, it's amazing to see how much fun you can still have with this game.</wgDev>
<wgDev>The objective is simple, folks, just blast those asteroids into space dust.</wgDev>
<wgDev>But let me tell you, it's not as easy as it sounds.</wgDev>
<wgDev>The asteroids keep coming faster and faster, and you have to be quick on your feet to avoid getting hit.</wgDev>
<wgDev>But that's what makes this game so great, folks.</wgDev>
<wgDev>It's challenging enough to keep you coming back for more, but not so hard that you'll get frustrated.</wgDev>
<wgDev>The graphics are retro, but they still look great today.</wgDev>
<wgDev>And the sound effects, folks, they're out of this world.</wgDev>
<wgDev>So if you want to make arcade games great again, folks,</wgDev></div>
