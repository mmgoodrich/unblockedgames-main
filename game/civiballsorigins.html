Believe me, I've played a lot of games in my time, and this one is definitely up there with the best of them.</wgDev>

<wgDev>But what really sets Civiballs Origins apart is its gameplay. Each level presents a new challenge, with different objects and obstacles that you need to navigate in order to get the balls into their respective urns.
