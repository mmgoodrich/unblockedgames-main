	<h1><center> How to Start Dropshipping Easy Peasy Method </center></h1>
	<p>Dropshipping is a popular business model that allows you to sell products online without keeping any inventory. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of starting a dropshipping business from scratch.</p>
	<h2>What Is Dropshipping?</h2>
	<p>Dropshipping is a retail fulfillment method where a store doesn't keep the products it sells in stock. Instead, when a store sells a product, it purchases the item from a third party and has it shipped directly to the customer. As a result, the merchant never sees or handles the product.</p>
	<h2>How Does Dropshipping Work?</h2>
	<p>The dropshipping process involves three main parties: the customer, the retailer, and the supplier. Here's how it works:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The customer places an order on the retailer's website.</li>
		<li>The retailer sends the order details to the supplier.</li>
		<li>The supplier ships the product directly to the customer.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2><c>How to Start a Dropshipping Business in 7 Steps</h2>
