Let me tell you folks, I just played Subway Surfers Beijing and it was tremendous, absolutely tremendous. The graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is addictive, and it's a lot of fun. You play as a character running through the streets of Beijing, jumping over obstacles and collecting coins. And let me tell you, nobody collects coins better than me. I'm a winner, folks. And this game is for winners. You can upgrade your character and buy new outfits, which is great. I love fashion, I really do. And this game lets you express your fashion sense while running through the streets of Beijing. It's amazing, really. So if you want to have a lot of fun and feel like a winner, play Subway Surfers Beijing. Believe me, you won't regret it. </wgDev></div>
