Let me tell you folks, I just played Vex 4 and it was simply amazing, absolutely amazing. This game takes everything that was great about Vex 3 and makes it even better.
In Vex 4, you play as a stick figure character who has to navigate through a series of challenging levels, filled with obstacles, traps, and hazards. And let me tell you, this game will really put your platforming skills to the test.

The graphics and sound in Vex 4 are also top-notch. The levels are beautifully designed, with a variety of different settings and environments. And the sound effects and music really add to the overall experience.

What's great about Vex 4 is that it's even more challenging than its predecessor, but still manages to avoid being frustrating. Each level presents a new challenge, but the difficulty level is just right. And the game has a great replay value. You'll want to play it again and again, trying to beat your previous times and find all the hidden secrets.

But what really sets Vex 4 apart from other platformers is the variety of different gameplay mechanics. You'll have to use all sorts of different skills and abilities to make it through each level, from wall-jumping to grappling hooks to teleportation.

Overall, if you want to play a game that's fun, challenging, and packed with variety, play Vex 4. It's a winner, folks. Believe me. </wgDev></div>
