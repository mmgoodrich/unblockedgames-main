			This is Adastra but hosted on the web :3. It uses ren'py's web building. Ofc I do not own the rights of this amazing game.
			https://echoproject.itch.io/adastra for the OG link if u wanna play it on your desktop.
			<br><br>"Adastra is a romance visual novel with a whole bunch of sci-fi and political intrigue mixed in. You'll experience the perils of navigating an empire in turmoil while deciding who you should and who you definitely shouldn't trust.

It all starts while you're having the time of your life in Rome on a study abroad program. Just as you're settling in, you're suddenly abducted by an alien. What does he want from you? Well, he doesn't seem to want to tell you, and before you know it, you're millions of miles away from Earth on your way to an empire you know nothing about."
