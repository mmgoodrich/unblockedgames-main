Let me tell you folks, I just played Win the White House and it was tremendous, absolutely tremendous. It's a game that lets you run for President of the United States and let me tell you, nobody knows more about running for President than me, nobody. You start off as a candidate and you have to make strategic decisions to win over voters and secure key endorsements. It's a game of strategy and you have to be smart to win. And let me tell you, I'm very smart. The graphics are great, the gameplay is fantastic, and it's very addictive. Believe me, I know addictive games. I've played them all. And this one is a winner, folks. So if you want to be a winner too, play Win the White House. </wgDev></div>
