</style> <div id="gamedesc" ><wgdev>Let me tell you, folks, Five Nights at Freddy's 3 is a game that'll keep you on the edge of your seat. It's a continuation of the story from the first two games, but with some new twists and turns.

The graphics in FNAF 3 are just fantastic, folks. The game takes place in an abandoned pizza restaurant, and the atmosphere is just creepy. The dimly lit hallways, the flickering lights, and the animatronic characters all contribute to a feeling of unease and tension.

The gameplay in FNAF 3 is different from the first two games. You'll be playing as a security guard, tasked with keeping an eye on the animatronics through a set of surveillance cameras. But here's the twist, folks: the animatronics in this game are not as active as in the previous games. Instead, you'll have to deal with a new threat: a ghostly version of the original animatronic, Springtrap.

But what really sets FNAF 3 apart is its story. You'll uncover the dark history of the pizza restaurant, and learn the truth about what happened to the animatronics. And the jump scares in this game are just tremendous, folks. They'll make you jump out of your seat.

So if you're looking for a game that's going to keep you on the edge of your seat, then FNAF 3 is the game for you, folks. It's just fantastic, it's tremendous, and it's going to make you jump. Give it a try, believe me. </wgdev></div>
