</style> <div id="gamedesc" ><wgDev>Cut the Rope is an amazing game, believe me. It's tremendous, really, really great. The gameplay is so addictive, you won't be able to put it down. The goal of the game is to cut ropes in the right way to feed candy to a cute little monster named Om Nom. And let me tell you, Om Nom is the greatest monster you'll ever meet, just fantastic. The graphics are top-notch, really beautiful. And the sound effects, oh boy, they're just perfect. I've played a lot of games in my time, but this one is really special. It's a winner, folks, a real winner. </div>
