<wgDev>But what really sets Baseball Stars apart from other baseball games is the gameplay.</wgDev>
<wgDev>The controls are easy to pick up, but difficult to master, giving you a real sense of accomplishment as you make your way through the game.</wgDev>
<wgDev>And the AI is some of the best I've ever seen in a sports game.</wgDev>
<wgDev>The opposing teams are challenging, but never unfair, and you'll need to use strategy and skill to come out on top.</wgDev>
<wgDev>But it's not just the gameplay that makes Baseball Stars so great.</wgDev>

<wgDev>And the game even includes a season mode, where you can play through a full season of baseball and compete for the championship.</wgDev>
<wgDev>Overall, Baseball Stars is an absolute must-play for any fan of baseball or sports games in general.</wgDev>
<wgDev>With its stunning graphics, realistic sound effects, and deep gameplay and customization options, it's a game that you won't be able to put down, believe me.</wgDev></div>
