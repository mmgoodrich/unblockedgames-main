Let me tell you, folks, "Learn to Fly" is a tremendous game. It's a game about penguins, and let me tell you, nobody knows penguins better than me. I've had penguins at my resorts, they love me. And this game, it's just like me - it's a winner. 
You start out as a penguin who can't even fly, but you know what? With hard work and determination, you can make that penguin soar. It's all about perseverance, folks. And let me tell you, I know a thing or two about perseverance.

The graphics are top notch, let me tell you. Beautifully designed, just like my hotels. And the gameplay? It's addictive. I've been playing this game for hours, folks.

So if you want to learn to fly like a penguin, this is the game for you. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. It's a great game, a tremendous game, and it's going to be huge. </wgDev></div>
