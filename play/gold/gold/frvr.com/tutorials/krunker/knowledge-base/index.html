<img class="max-w-[8rem]" src="../hunter.png"/>
<p><strong>Run n Gun</strong><br/>
Run N Gun is designed for a fast-moving playstyle, with one of the fastest movement speeds in the game, and equipped with the SMG which has a very high fire rate but low damage output. It can also wall jump and wall grind.</p>
<img class="max-w-[8rem]" src="../runngun.png"/>
<p><strong>Spray n Pray</strong><br/>
Spray N’ Pray is essentially a tank class, which has the highest health but is also the slowest in the game. He has an LMG which holds the largest amount of ammunition. It’s also the only class that cannot jump on top of any objects without using the knife for extra mobility.</p>
<img class="max-w-[8rem]" src="../spraynpray.png"/>
<p><strong>Vince</strong><br/>
Vince is the only class with a real name, as opposed to the other classes.
His primary weapon is the Shotgun which is only effective at close range, however, this can be overcome with movement, using shotgun jumping.</p>
<img class="max-w-[8rem]" src="../vince.png"/>
<p><strong>The Detective</strong><br/>
The Detective is a fast class effective at medium to long ranges due to the light weight of his weapon which is the Revolver, however, it has a slow rate of fire, but does incredible damage.</p>
<img class="max-w-[8rem]" src="../detective.png"/>
<p><strong>The Marksman</strong><br/>
The Marksman is a balanced class with a Semi-Auto, which is very effective at medium range.</p>
<img class="max-w-[8rem]" src="../marksman.png"/>
<p><strong>The Rocketeer</strong><br/>
The Rocketeer is a heavy class, often easy to play but hard to master, with the second-highest health and the second-lowest speed in the game. However, it can increase its mobility and jump onto environmental objects by switching to a secondary weapon or melee.</p>
<img class="max-w-[8rem]" src="../rocketeer.png"/>
<p><strong>Agent</strong><br/>
The Agent is currently the only class that can wield two weapons at once, which are two Akimbo Uzis. Overall, it’s a very aggressive, fast-moving, short-ranged class that can wall jump and wall grind.</p>
<img class="max-w-[8rem]" src="../agent.png"/>
<p><strong>The Runner</strong><br/>
The Runner is a very mobile class that uses a Knife. Mainly used in Parkour maps or runner-only combat custom games, but with the ability to do wall jumps and wall grinds, is also effective in close range in normal game modes. It can also throw knives, but the range is low.</p>
<img class="max-w-[8rem]" src="../runner.png"/>
<p><strong>Deagler</strong><br/>
The Deagler is one of the two classes only playable in custom games, the other being The Survivor.
Its weapon is the Desert Eagle and the secondary weapon can only be unlocked at level 15.</p>
<img class="max-w-[8rem]" src="../deagler.png"/>
<p><strong>Bowman</strong><br/>
Bowman is a high-risk, high-reward class, with an emphasis on accuracy, timing, and reflexes. Its weapon, the Bow, can deal high damage and has the fastest reload speed in the game, but it only has one ammo.</p>
<img class="max-w-[8rem]" src="../bowman.png"/>
<p><strong>The Commando</strong><br/>
The Commando is a rifle class and its weapon is the FAMAS, a 3-bullet burst rifle, which is average at all ranges and doesn’t have any significant advantage. This class is often compared to Triggerman.</p>
<img class="max-w-[8rem]" src="../commando.png"/>
<p><strong>Trooper</strong><br/>
The Trooper is a class effective at all ranges, its weapon is the Blaster whose fire rate is automatic, but very slow. He’s also able to wall jump but is unable to equip a secondary weapon.
The play style of the trooper is similar to that of the Triggerman and its strength comes from its ability to burst down enemies quickly.</p>
<img class="max-w-[8rem]" src="../trooper.png"/>
<p><strong>The Survivor</strong><br/>
The Survivor is one of the two classes only playable in custom games, the other being the Deagler, and introduces building mechanics into Krunker, as one can build blocks, walls, platforms, and stairs. The survivor class does not have a secondary weapon and its primary weapon is the Build Tool.</p>
<img class="max-w-[8rem]" src="../survivor.png"/>
<p><strong>Infiltrator</strong><br/>
The Infiltrator is a very high-risk, high-reward class similar to the Bowman. With a lower health of 90 HP compared to the normal 100 HP most other classes have, it has medium movement speed and she wields a unique weapon which is the Charge Rifle, that requires good tracking to be able to consistently farm kills.</p>
<img class="max-w-[8rem]" src="../infiltrator.png"/>
<h2 id="game-modes">Game Modes</h2>
<p>In Krunker there are 25 game modes available to play and are divided into 3 categories, Public, Party and Community</p>
<img class="max-w-xl" src="../krunker%20game%20modes.png"/>
<p><strong>Public Game Modes</strong><br/>
They are the game modes on the official servers where you can earn KR and XP, have a 4-minute timer, and once it ends the winner is determined by their kills and deaths score, along with the other stats in the players’ profile. They can also be played on custom games.<br/>
Note: Profile stats won’t be affected unless you play until the end of the match, but leaving a game before the timer ends will count as a lost game.</p>
<p><strong>Party Game Modes</strong><br/>
The Party game modes work like Public Game Modes and one of them is available as the 4th option in the voting system.</p>
<p><strong>Community Modes</strong><br/>
These modes can be achieved by changing some settings and using special maps.</p>
<p><strong>Voting System</strong><br/>
The voting system allows players to select the game mode and map which they will be playing next. The 4th option is always a unique mode. (e.g. Party Game Modes)</p>

In the Shop you can buy KR and bundles that also give you items and cosmetics.

<p><strong>Missions</strong><br/>
The player must be Level 15 to be able to access the Missions, which are a set of tasks that a player can complete to earn KR while playing. Abandoning a match will result in the loss of challenge progress.
The rewards and difficulty of completing the challenges are increased, as you progress and they can only be done in normal public games, Custom Games won’t count.
Missions give KR, Junk, and cosmetic rewards and are divided into the following categories:</p>
<img class="max-w-md" src="../missions.png"/>
